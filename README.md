## 🧠 Architecture and Logic

<details>
<summary>📂 Click to expand</summary>

### **AtlasOS**
- Highly modular and sprawling system — the master `custom.yml` script orchestrates dozens of submodules.  
- Each tweak lives in a specific YAML file (e.g., `tweaks\qol\explorer\disable-check-boxes.yml`).  
- Incredibly flexible but harder to oversee at a glance.

### **ReviOS**
- Simpler and cleaner structure — `main.yml` calls task categories (`packages`, `registry`, `services`).  
- Registry tweaks are grouped logically (explorer, privacy, system).  
- Easier to maintain and understand but less granular.

## 🧹 Debloating and App Removal

<details>
<summary>🗑️ Click to expand</summary>

### **AtlasOS**
- Uses DISM, AppX, and PowerShell scripts (`RemoveEdge.ps1`, `components.yml`).  
- Removes many apps safely — Cortana, Teams, Weather, Alarms, Edge, OneDrive.  

### **ReviOS**
- Uses dedicated PowerShell scripts (`APPX-REMOVER.ps1`, `EDGE.ps1`).  
- More **aggressive** — uninstalls AI features like **Recall** and **Copilot**.  
- Temporarily changes region to force Edge removal.
</details>

## ⚙️ Performance and Optimization

<details>
<summary>🚀 Click to expand</summary>

### **AtlasOS**
- Dedicated `performance` folder.  
- Tunes MMCSS, disables service host splitting, optimizes NTFS, adjusts power schemes.  

### **ReviOS**
- Focuses on fewer, but stronger tweaks:  
  - Disables memory compression.  
  - Prioritizes foreground apps.  
  - Adds custom “Ultra Performance” power plan.  
</details>

## 🔒 Privacy and Telemetry

<details>
<summary>🕵️ Click to expand</summary>

### **AtlasOS**
- Huge privacy section (advertising, telemetry, cloud, NVIDIA, Office).  
- Disables a wide range of scheduled tasks, services, and registry keys.

### **ReviOS**
- Privacy handled mainly through registry tweaks.  
- Targets Microsoft telemetry (CEIP, WER) but less extensive overall.
</details>

## 🎨 Customization and Quality of Life (QoL)

<details>
<summary>🎛️ Click to expand</summary>

### **AtlasOS**
- Massive `qol` folder — adds context menu options, restores old menus, applies Atlas theme, and includes **Atlas Toolbox**.  
- Ideal for power users who want control over UI and feel.

### **ReviOS**
- Minimalist approach — legacy context menu, dark mode, wallpaper changes, unpins Start items.  
- Focused on clean aesthetics and simplicity.
