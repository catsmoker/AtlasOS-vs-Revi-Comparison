**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Disclaimer

This is just my personal take after looking at both playbooks. I'm not promoting either project and I'm not responsible if something goes wrong on your system. Always backup your stuff before making changes.

## Quick Overview

**AtlasOS v0.5.0 RC4**
- Philosophy: Feature-rich and highly customizable
- playbook Structure: Around 452 files with modular YAML setup
- playbook Complexity: High - lots of flexibility but harder to manage
- Speed: Slower deployment due to many tweaks

**Revi-PB 25.10 (ReviOS)**
- Philosophy: Minimalist and performance-focused
- playbook Structure: About 77 files, more compact
- playbook Complexity: Lower - cleaner and more stable
- Speed: Faster and lighter overall

---

## Playbook Architecture

**AtlasOS**
Uses a main `custom.yml` file that calls dozens of smaller modules. Each tweak has it's own file which gives you tons of control but can be overwhelming.

**ReviOS**
Simpler structure with `main.yml` coordinating everything. Registry tweaks are grouped logically making it easier to understand whats going on.

---

## Debloating

**AtlasOS**
Removes apps safely using DISM and PowerShell. Gets rid of Cortana, Teams, Weather, OneDrive and other bloat.

**ReviOS**
More aggressive approach - removes AI features like Recall and Copilot. Even temporarily changes region settings to force remove certain apps.

---

## Performance

**AtlasOS**
Has dedicated performance folder with MMCSS tuning, service optimization, NTFS tweaks, and power scheme adjustments.

**ReviOS**
Focuses on fewer but stronger tweaks - disables memory compression, prioritizes foreground apps, adds custom "Ultra Performance" power plan. Generally more stable performance gains.

---

## Privacy

**AtlasOS**
Extensive privacy section covering advertising, telemetry, cloud services, NVIDIA tracking, Office telemetry. Disables alot of scheduled tasks and registry keys.

**ReviOS**
Handles privacy mainly through registry tweaks. Targets Microsoft telemetry but less comprehensive then AtlasOS.

---

## Customization

**AtlasOS**
Massive customization options - context menu changes, old menu styles, Atlas theme, includes Atlas Toolbox. Perfect for power users who want full control.

**ReviOS**
Minimal approach - legacy context menu, dark mode, wallpaper changes. Focused on simplicity and clean look.
