---

## üìò Overview

| **Aspect** | **AtlasOS v0.5.0 RC4** | **Revi-PB 25.10** |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Feature-rich, modular, deeply customizable Windows optimization playbook. | Minimalist, performance-focused debloated Windows playbook. |
| **Folder Structure** | Complex and modular (`atlas`, `tweaks`, etc.), hundreds of YAML files grouped by category. | Simple structure (`Tasks` folder with `packages` and `registry` subfolders). |
| **Deployment Speed** | Slower ‚Äî many tweaks and scripts executed. | Faster ‚Äî fewer tasks and lighter scope. |
| **Scripting Logic** | Modern, modular YAML design with reduced redundancy. | Linear task execution; simpler but may duplicate commands. |
| **PowerShell / CMD Usage** | Uses both PowerShell and CMD scripts. | Also uses both; simpler flow. |
| **Modularity (YAML Design)** | Excellent ‚Äî highly structured and category-based. | Limited ‚Äî compact design with fewer modular elements. |
| **Ease of Debugging** | Easier to isolate issues (modular). | Easier overall (small scope). |
| **Registry & Services Handling** | Disables services safely; wide registry coverage, possible overlap. | Aggressive debloating; fewer registry edits. |
| **Performance** | Good ‚Äî depends on selected tweaks; some may add overhead. | Excellent ‚Äî lighter footprint, faster boot, and lower RAM use. |
| **Network Optimization** | Dedicated networking tweaks (DNS, latency, LLMNR). | Basic network cleanup only. |
| **Power Management** | Includes detailed power-tuning scripts. | Default Windows behavior, simpler setup. |
| **Stability / Reliability** | Good, but complexity increases bug potential. | Excellent, due to simplicity and small codebase. |
| **Compatibility (Win11 24H2+)** | More complex; may require future maintenance. | Fewer deep changes = better forward compatibility. |
| **Windows Update / Store / Defender** | May alter or disable some features. | Fewer changes, lower breakage risk. |
| **Maintenance** | Modular, easy to update individual tweaks. | Simple to maintain as a whole. |
| **Merge Compatibility** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended ‚Äî architectures conflict. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended. |
| **Privacy & Telemetry Blocking** | Extensive privacy folder (telemetry, ads, etc.). | Basic registry-based tweaks. |
| **Security Features** | May disable some Windows security options (config-dependent). | Safer defaults; fewer critical changes. |
| **Customization / Themes** | Very high ‚Äî includes QoL, UI, and theme tweaks. | Basic ‚Äî minimal visual customization. |
| **Visual Effects Impact** | Some optional effects can reduce performance slightly. | Minimal visuals, optimized for speed. |
| **User Experience** | ‚ÄúReady-to-use‚Äù and feature-rich desktop. | Barebones, clean starting point. |
| **Enterprise / Multi-user Support** | Limited ‚Äî includes some user scripts. | Single-user focus; not enterprise-ready. |

### üí° Notes

- Merging both playbooks is **not recommended** due to different architectures and task logic.  
- Both modify system components ‚Äî always create a restore point or test on a VM before applying.  
- AtlasOS offers more flexibility; Revi-PB offers more predictability.
